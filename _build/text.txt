Wanted Queries
This project is to create a web form that will generate the text as if to submit to the NCIC to add, edit, or delete a warrant.

It is assumed that if incorrect entry occurs, the proper error message will be displayed to assist the user in correcting their mistakes.

Menu
There should be a popout menu at the top left to navigate between the Home, Enter, Modify, and Cancel screens.

The requirements are as follows for each screen, and the results:
Home
Enter Wanted Requirements
Modify Wanted Requirements
Cancel Wanted Requirements
Error Handling
Any error in entry should have a contexcualized error displayed in a bulleted list the same area a valid query would have appeared. No assembled query will appear, instead you will see a message 'No results generated due to error.' Any field that has an incorrect entry will also be highlighted in red until emptied out or resubmitted.

See below for an example of each error message.

Required field missing
Invalid characters entered
Invalid length
Invalid date

Environment
The forms should be usable in any modern browser, mobile or desktop, but will be supported mainly in the desktop version of Chrome. It is possible bugs will persist in other versions/browsers.
